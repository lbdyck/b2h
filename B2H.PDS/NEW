==========================================================================
20 May 2002 - Release 4.7 (Internal level 390)
 
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
 
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  B2H will now run under Regina Rexx (Release 3.0 or higher).
     Regina is a free Rexx implementation which can be used as an
     alternative to IBM's Object Rexx and is available at
     http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/
 
  o  B2H will now support and run in Unix when run under Regina Rexx
 
  o  Multiple lines generated by ".sk" or ".sp" are being ignored by
     modern web browsers due to their suppressing multiple blank lines.
     Output created by B2H altered to prevent this suppression.
 
  o  When run on Windows or OS/2, a filename enclosed in double-quote
     characters is now accepted on the command line.  This to ensure
     consistency with other filename handling routines in Windows and OS/2.
 
  o  Additional HTML tags can now be customized.  The HTMLATT= option was
     enhanced to support customization of the <A>, <DD>, <DT>, <FORM>,
     <IMG> and <INPUT> HTML tags.
 
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
   HTMLATT.tagname='text'                            (additional tagnames)
 
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  Section added regarding the REXX versions under which B2H will run
 
 
System profile updates:
-----------------------
  o  Various default definitions added for UNIX support
 
 
System symbol table updates:
---------------------------
  o  Definitions for ".SK" and ".SP" updated
 
 
Bugs fixed:
-----------
  o  Some system-type &symbols were not defined, including '&$ASCI',
     '&$FNAM', '&$PDEV' and '&b2hrevchar'
  o  Text after ":lp." discarded when ":lp." not within a table
  o  On the mainframe, referencing a single "&" returns the current
     page number, but B2H was returning a "&" causing arithmetic
     errors when used in a numeric expression.  B2H now returns a "1"
     (because the web is a "pageless" environment).
  o  Message B2H306 showing lines written to the log file is sometimes
     too low
 
 
 
==========================================================================
22 May 2001 - Release 4.6  (Internal level 383)
 
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
  o  Support &X'hhhh symbol value attribute (convert hex characters)
 
  o  Additional DCF symbols defined to more closely emulate the
     mainframe environment (e.g. &$ASCI, &$PSNO)
 
  o  "ON/OFF" option of the ".rc" control word now supported
     (e.g. ".rc 1 on/off")
 
  o  FRAME=RULES now recognized and supported on the :FIG tag
 
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  Tag delimiter character(s) may be changed using the .DC control word;
     Tag delimiters can even be turned off (.DC GML OFF)
 
  o  If :TDESC is encountered in a table, but not ended using :ETDESC,
     the :ETABLE tag will end the :TDESC.  (:ETDESC. tag is not required
     in all "flavors" of GML/Bookmaster.)
 
  o  If :ADDRESS is encountered, but not ended using :EADDRESS, either the
     :ETITLE or :ETITLEP tag will end the :ADDRESS.  If neither :ETITLE
     or :ETITLEP is encountered, a "missing :EADDRESS" message is issued.
 
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
   BORDERTAG='tag'                              (new option)
   BORDERTAG.x='tag'                            (new option)
   HRTAG.x='tag'                                (HRTAG.4 now used)
 
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  New appendix section lists the supported system-type &symbols
     (e.g. &SYSYEAR, &$INDX, &$PDEV)
 
 
System profile updates:
-----------------------
  None
 
 
System symbol table updates:
---------------------------
  None
 
 
Bugs fixed:
-----------
  o  Abend when using :XLATEO. symbol table statement
  o  :LITDATA with NAME= attribute not always handled correctly
  o  .MG doesn't recognize delimiter characters other than '/'
  o  Symbols starting with '$' not always upper-cased before use
  o  Trailing period after a "&cont" or "&$CONT" not supposed to be required
  o  When running B2H as a pipeline filter on MVS or VM and specifying
     LOG=STREAMx, log records are not written to the specified pipeline
     output stream.
  o  Multiple occurances of "&TEXT" or "&TEXTALL" not being substituted
     within a symbol table definition
  o  Value used for .SE assignment not taken "as-is" when equal sign omitted
     Example: .SE abc 'Mrs. O'Leary's cow
       "abc" was set to:  Mrs. O                 (incorrect)
       "abc" now set to:  Mrs. O'Leary's cow     (correct)
  o  When "splitting" the HTML output, if the tag causing the split
     is *immediately* preceded by an :exmp tag, the "</PRE>" is
     inadvertently inserted at the beginning of the new output file
     instead of at the end of the current output file
 
==========================================================================
24 May 2000 - Release 4.5  (Internal level 377)
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
  o  .DC control word with CW and GML options now supported
  o  .BF, .PF and .PI control words are now supported
  o  Multiple :AUTHOR tags now supported
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  The parser has been updated which allows the following enhancements:
     - "Splitting" of the output HTML is now supported for SOURCE=SCRIPTONLY
     - When SOURCE=SCRIPTONLY, all control words "mapped" to Bookmaster/GML
       tags are now supported.  Prior to R4.5, control words that were
       normally handled by simply "mapping" them to their Bookmaster/GML
       equivalent (e.g. .FN to :FN., .Hx to :Hx.) were not supported when
       SOURCE=SCRIPTONLY.
     - Tag delimiter character(s) may be changed using the .DC control word
 
  o  Symbol table records can now be imbedded within the source document
     using the new ".*B2H SYMBOL" statement
 
  o  Improved support for character set translations:
     -  New :XLATEO. symbol table statement allows translations specific
        to *output* HTML records
     -  :XLATEI. symbol table statement (was :XLATE.) allows translations
        specific to *input* source records
     -  Improved handling of .TI and .TR
 
  o  New LINENUM= option allows B2H to recognize and ignore line numbers
     in source records
 
  o  A label cell is no longer generated for :SYNTAX STYLE=LBLBOX if no
     label data has been provided
 
  o  Empty syntax diagrams are now suppressed
 
  o  If a .RE (restore environment) control word changes the pre-formatting
     status of the output, the appropriate HTML tags are now generated
     to automatically compensate
 
  o  The DLFMT= and GLFMT= options now default to TABLE if generating
     HTML 3 (or higher); if generating HTML 2, both default to DL
 
  o  Additional diagnostics provided for I/O and allocation errors under MVS
 
  o  To show a vertical bar, such as those used for syntax diagrams and
     the :SCREEN tag, B2H now generates "&#124;" instead of a physical
     vertical bar.  (This circumvents a problem experienced by some users
     where their upload/download process was translating a vertical bar
     into something else.)
 
  o  In a profile file, comments may now be placed after any option(s)
     by preceding the comment with two dashes (--).   This capability
     was already available for the symbol table file.
 
  o  Indentation of multi-line messages within the B2H log was changed
     to improve readability
 
  o  Support for ".im xeditg1" and ".im xeditg2" changed to now insert
     "<PRE>" or "</PRE>" instead of ":XMP." and ":EXMP."
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
   DEFTEXT.name='text'                                  (additional names)
   FONTTAG='fonttext,efonttext,<PROP|NOPROP>'           (new option)
   H3ADDONS={ YES | NO }                                (removed - obsolete)
   H3TABLE={ COMPLEX | SIMPLE }                         (removed - obsolete)
   INDEXREFLINK={ YES | NO }                            (new option)
   LINENUM={ NO | BEGIN | END | startcol-endcol }       (new option)
   PROCACT='... '                                       (additional operand)
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  Section added on how to use only Script/VS control words to
     include/exclude text when converting to HTML
  o  "Using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)", "Creating a 'clickable' web link"
     and "Ignoring source record line numbers" added to
     Frequently-Asked-Questions section
  o  Document new message numbers 109, 152, 317 and 318
  o  Miscellaneous updates to reflect the changes for R4.5
 
System profile updates:
-----------------------
  o  Show defaults for new options
  o  Change vertical bars to "&#124;"
 
System symbol table updates:
---------------------------
  o  ":XLATE." statement renamed to ":XLATEI."
     (":XLATE." still supported, but ":XLATEI." preferred)
  o  ".SD" Script/VS control word defined as being ignored
  o  Change definition of ".BF", ".DC", ".PF" and ".PI" from ignored
     to handled internally
 
Bugs fixed (R4.5):
------------------
  o  When B2H is run on a platform *other* than MVS, file(s) specified for
     the HEADER= and FOOTER= options are not found due to B2H enclosing the
     name within single-quote characters.
 
  o  When running B2H as a pipeline filter on MVS or VM and specifying
     LOG=STREAMx, log records are not written to the specified pipeline
     output stream.
 
  o  .SE arithmetic expression is incorrectly evaluated as a string when
     the expression's elements are not separated by blanks.
       .se abc = 2 + &xyz * 1             correctly handled
       .se abc = 2+&xyz*1                 was incorrectly handled
 
  o  The HTML generated for :LBLBOX and :SYNTAX STYLE=LBLBOX is missing a
     "</TR>".  (This is mostly a cosmetic fix as the user's browser will
     normally assume end-of-row.)
 
  o  Trailing blanks in fixed-length source records are not being
     ignored and may cause extra lines within pre-formatted output
     (e.g. :LINES, :XMP)
 
  o  Within :LITDATA/:ELITDATA, all records are supposed to be handled
     "as-is", however if B2H encounters a *valid* Bookmaster tag, the
     tag's syntax is checked and warning messages issued if the syntax
     is incorrect.
 
  o  If a table of contents (TOC) is generated *without* a :TOC. tag
     explicitly specified in the source file, the first :Hx tag may have
     an invalid hotlink target of HREF="&b2htoc_1".
 
  o  Tag names containing '@' (at sign), '#' (number sign) or
     '$' (dollar sign) were not handled correctly
 
  o  PG= attribute ignored on the :I1, :I2, :I3 and :IREF tags
 
  o  If within a <PRE> and </PRE>, an extra blank line is generated for
     the .SX control word and the :Ix, :IHx, :LBLBOX, :QUALIF and
     :SYNTAX tags
 
  o  In the index, every 5th reference for an index entry contains an
     extraneous blank
 
  o  For .TI and .TR, specifying a translation does not override a previous
     specification for the same source value
 
  o  Index reference links point to incorrect file when B2H invoked as a
     Pipeline filter
 
 
==========================================================================
 31 December 1999 - Release 4.4 (Internal level 367)
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
  o  :LP now properly left-aligned when within a :DL or :GL and
     a table is being generated (e.g. DLFMT=TABLE or GLFMT=TABLE)
  o  ".EF" now fully supported with or without the "CLOSE" operand
  o  Script/VS "&$CONT." and "&$TAB." symbols now supported
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  When B2H is run on MVS (OS/390), if the physical output file is
     DSORG=PS and is also pre-allocated, B2H will no longer delete and
     reallocate it, improving efficiency
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
  o  When B2H is run on MVS (OS/390), the HEADER= and FOOTER= options
     now support specifying the input file using the "DD:ddname" syntax
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  Clarify that the ".EF" control word is treated as ".EF CLOSE"
 
System profile updates:
-----------------------
  o  None
 
System symbol table updates:
---------------------------
  o  :COVER definition updated to correct "missing period" error messages
  o  &divide symbol added in addition to &divid
  o  &florin symbol added and mapped to &#402;
 
Bugs fixed:
-----------
  o  Attributes coded on a :COVER tag cause erroneous warning message
     and included in the output HTML
  o  .SE sometimes treated as arithmetic expression when it's really not
  o  Font changes (e.g. :REV, .RC) within an example (:XMP/:EXMP)
     generate blank lines
  o  Abend under MVS (OS/390) when evaluating a previously-allocated
     concatenated DD card
 
 
==========================================================================
  7 June 1999 - Release 4.3 (Internal level 362)
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
  o  If an :ADDRESS tag is encountered within :PROLOG/:EPROLOG, hold the
     text until the formal title page is generated; otherwise display
     the address text as encountered.
  o  :COVER now treated as a synonym of :TIPAGE; both tags now generate
     a formal title page
 
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  LOG= option now accepts an asterisk (*), which is dynamically replaced
     by the input filename.  Allows the log file to automatically be named
     according to the input file
       Example:  B2H timecard.sct ( LOG='*.b2h'
       Result:   the log is written to 'timecard.b2h'
       Example:  B2H project script ( LOG='* B2HLOG A'
       Result:   the log is written to 'PROJECT B2HLOG A'
  o  When running as a Pipeline filter, B2H now supports writing log records
     to a pipeline output stream
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
   See LOG= description above
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  Describe new B2H128 message
  o  Minor updates to reflect R4.3
 
System profile updates:
---------------------------
  o  None
 
System symbol table updates:
---------------------------
  o  Change definition of "&OELIG" to "&OElig"
  o  Defined ":ETOC" and ":EDOCPROF" as ignored tags
  o  Recognize "&$RB." as meaning a blank
  o  Define :COVER, :PROLOG/:EPROLOG as internal tags
 
Bugs fixed:
-----------
  o  When creating HTML 3, SCALE= values less than 1 (e.g. SCALE='0.9')
     generate a much-too-small font size (often <FONT SIZE="0">)
  o  When run on AIX, did not always recognize the platform as being AIX
  o  Splitting the output in the middle of a Messages & Code list when a
     message has *only* a :MSG and (optional) :MSGNO tag results in incorrect
     HTML output.
  o  Integer arithmetic not used within .SE expressions
  o  An ".OR" on the same physical record as an ".IF" is inadvertently
     not processed if the ".IF" condition is false
  o  Within a :TFT/:ETFT (table footer): text on same line after a Script/VS
     control word shows *after* the entire table instead of *within* the
     table's footer
  o  :TOC tag processed as an <H2> tag instead of <H1>
  o  ID= attribute on a :TOC tag not handled correctly
  o  Under MVS: concatenated pre-allocated DD cards not always found
 
 
==========================================================================
   3 December 1998 - Release 4.2         (Internal level 359)
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
  o  :CGDEF and :XMPDEF tags now supported
  o  APPHD1=, APPHD1X= and DIALOG= attributes now supported on
     the :DOCPROF tag
  o  SCALE= attribute now supported on the following tags: :CGRAPHIC,
     :CODEL, :DIALOG, :DIRECT, :FIG, :MSGL, :SCHDATE, :SCREEN, :SYNTAX,
     :TABDATA, :TABLE and :XMP
  o  TEXT= attribute now supported on the :AUTHOR tag
  o  LEVEL= attribute now supported on the :DOCNUM tag
  o  Within a table, when too many :C tags are encountered for a logical
     row, a :ROW tag is automatically inserted to force a new row
  o  The IBM-internal CAPBC=, EQBC= and FNBC= attributes on the
     :DOCPROF tag no longer cause a warning message to be issued
  o  The IBM-internal :DFREF tag no longer causes a warning message
     to be issued
 
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  HTML 4 output now supported
  o  Layout of a formal title page now corresponds more closely to the
     Bookmaster standard
  o  Appearance of :H5 though :H20 now corresponds more closely to
     Bookmaster's default layout (see new HTAG= option)
  o  Propagation of font color changes used with .RC/:REV/:EREV
     can be enabled/disabled on a per-revision code basis
  o  Footnote appearance can now be customized using the new FNTAG= option.
     (Thanks to Mark Gaubatz for his code update that led to this
     enhancement!)  Default footnote id now displayed as a superscript
     instead of normal text enclosed in parentheses.
  o  Improved HTML output for Bookmaster tables which use ARRANGE=
  o  Improved HTML output for Bookmaster's Messages and Codes tags
  o  Improved HTML output for Bookmaster's Dialog tags
  o  Improved appearance and customization capability for syntax diagrams
  o  The ability to selectively process profile records, symbol table
     records and ".*B2H" statements has been enhanced by allowing the HTML
     release level being generated to also be a selection criteria
  o  The new "SETUPTAG.tagname=" option allows you to define HTML statements
     to precede/follow the output generated for a particular GML/Bookmaster
     tag.  For example, you could specify that a certain font be loaded
     specifically for :CGRAPHIC. diagrams or cause the entire title page
     to be centered or right-justified.
  o  New "HTMLDOCID.rel=" option allows you to explicitly specify the Document
     Type Definition value for the first record of the HTML output -- the
     "xxx" in the following:
       <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML xxx//EN">
  o  New :PSC definitions 'HTML3+', 'HTML3+' and 'HTML4+' added to
     allow more generalized selection of text
  o  New ".*B2H MSG" statement added to allow messages to be issued (and
     the return code set) from within the document.  Can also be returned
     from a user program to show messages and set return codes.
 
  o  New "HEADREC=" option provides the ability to insert records into the
     header section of the output HTML file.  Most commonly used to include
     JavaScript code.
 
  o  All options, statements and text regarding "splitting" of the output
     HTML file have been renamed for consistency.  The use of "BREAK" and
     "PART" have been changed to "SPLIT":
     o  "AUTOPART=" is now "AUTOSPLIT=",
     o  "PARTDIGITS=" is now "SPLITDIGITS=",
     o  "PARTDIR=" is now "SPLITDIGITS=",
     o  "PARTLINK=" is now "SPLITLINK=",
     o  "PARTNAMES=" is now "SPLITNAMES=",
     o  The ".*B2H BREAK" statement is now ".*B2H SPLIT"
     For downward compatibility, all the old names are still recognized as
     aliases of their new official names.
 
     Both the "SPLITDIR.x=" and "SPLITNAME.x=" options now allow the 'x'
     value to be specified as 'NEXT', which allows you to name the 'next'
     split file, wherever and whenever it occurs.
 
  o  Advanced ability to dynamically load user profile/symbol table based
     on 1st value of an option using 'option*=value' syntax

   TOCTAG='ls,le,is,ie,ts,te'                  (new operands)
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  Added a section describing the overall structure of each output HTML
     file and what is used to build it
  o  Document the support for :LEGEND, :SAFETY, :SYNDEF, :SYNNT and
     :SYNNTREF tags which previously were either inadvertently missing
     or incorrectly listed as unsupported.
  o  Restructure Appendix A.3 and A.5 to show any related B2H options
     for each control word and tag
  o  Update the caveat section to show that Bookmaster "style" files
     are not processed
  o  Document the changes for R4.2
 
 
System profile updates:
---------------------------
  o  Update default DEFTEXT values for syntax diagrams
  o  Set defaults for DIALOGTAG.x=, FNTAG=, HTAG.x=, HTMLDOCID.x=
     and TOCTAG= options
  o  Change the "PART"-type option names to "SPLIT"-type names
 
 
System symbol table updates:
---------------------------
  o  Change definition of "&invellip" to precede it with two blanks
  o  Show the following tags are now handled internally: Dialog tags,
     Messages and Codes tags, various title page tags and
     :CGRAPHIC/:ECGRAPHIC tags
  o  Other miscellaneous changes
 
 
Bugs fixed:
-----------
  o  B2H does not always terminate cleanly under AIX/LINUX when using
     a shell *other* than "ksh"
  o  If a ".GO" and it's "...label" both exist within a user macro, then
     macro invocations after the first cause "Backward GOTO not supported"
  o  Text specified for REVTAG= not always propagated into HTML tables
     generated "under the covers" for the following Bookmaster tags:
     :FIG, :LBLBOX, :NT, :SCREEN and :SYNTAX
  o  Various errors when a user macro referenced within another user macro
  o  "<BR>" should not be inserted following a "</PRE>" tag

==========================================================================
  15 August    1998 - Release 4.1    (Internal level 346)
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
  o  OLSEQ= now recognized on the :DOCPROF tag
  o  ".NF" and ".PP" control words now recognized
 
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  Year2000 support added
  o  B2H now executes on the LINUX platform
     (you must have IBM's Object REXX for LINUX installed)
  o  Font color changes used with .RC/:REV/:EREV are now propagated
     into HTML tables.
  o  For ordered lists, B2H now generates the appropriate <OL TYPE=x> tag
     to allow different numbering schemes based on the "nesting" of the list.
     This means the main list will be numbered, the first sub-list will have
     alphabetic indices, and so on.  The OLSEQ= option (also recognized on
     Bookmaster's :DOCPROF tag) can be used to override this behavior.
     The list item reference generated for :LIREF now reflects the actual
     indice.
  o  The SYNFONT= option now also affects how the :SYNNTREF tag is shown
  o  Support added for abbreviations of various tag attributes
     (e.g. "COL" for "COLS", "RETCODE" for "RETCODES")
 
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
   DESTSYS={AIX|HPFS|LINUX|MVS|OS2|VM|WIN95|WINNT}       (new operand)
   LIREF={ NO | ID | ACTUAL }                            (new operand)
   OLSEQ='AaxRryNn'                                      (new option)
     Allows definition of the 'dingbat' for sequencing ordered lists.
     Recognized as both a B2H option and also as an attribute on the
     :DOCPROF tag.
 
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  Document changes for R4.1
 
 
System profile updates:
---------------------------
  o  Add LINUX-awareness
  o  Add default value for DEFTEXT.ARTLABEL=
 
 
System symbol table updates:
---------------------------
  o  Define ".GOTO" as a valid control word
  o  Define subscript symbols &sub0-&sub9 and superscript symbols &sup0-&sup9
  o  Any text on the :MINDEX tag is now totally ignored
 
 
Bugs fixed:
-----------
  o  Text after a tag possibly dropped if tag on same physical line as
     :FIGLIST, :INDEX, :TDESC, :TNOTE or :TLIST
  o  Error in HTML generated for a :GT. after a :GRPSEP. if GLFMT=DL
  o  On MVS, DD allocations to "NULLFILE" not ignored
  o  On MVS, imbeds from a multi-dataset allocation not handled correctly
  o  ".GOTO" and ".GO TO" (alternative forms of ".GO") not recognized
  o  Abend if ":H" coded with no character at all after the "H"
  o  ".GR" and ".NV" Script control words causing "Unknown control word"
     error message
  o  Abend under VM/CMS with "SET DATEFORMAT ISODATE"
  o  Consecutive tags with missing periods and no blanks between them
     (e.g. :p:ul:li:hp2.some text:ehp2:eul) causes erroneous
     "B2H403W Not a valid Bookmaster/GML tag" message
  o  :H1-type headers after a :BACKM. showing "Chapter x."
  o  "...label" statement ignored if within a user macro definition
  o  ".TI" control word not accumulating changes; only a ".TI" with no
     operands is supposed to clear previous translation definitions

  11 December 1997 - Release 4.01       (Internal level 336)
 
New or enhanced support of Bookmaster/GML/Script markup:
-------------------------------------------------------
  o  Syntax "railroad" diagrams now supported (:SYNTAX family of tags))
 
B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  On MVS, if the output file is explicitly specified, the OUTPUTP=
     option can now either reference the dataset itself or a FILE/DD, e.g.
       B2H ... ( OUTPUTP=ABC.HTML
       B2H ... ( OUTPUTP=ABC.HTML(MEMBER)
       B2H ... ( OUTPUTP=DD:ddname
       B2H ... ( OUTPUTP=DD:ddname(member)
  o  If an error occurs while writing an output file (e.g. output disk
     fills up), issue message 317 and stop
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
   DEFTEXT.name='text'
     Additional names to support :SYNNT. tag and drawing characters
   OUTPUTP={ filespec | DD:ddname | DD:ddname(member) }
     Allow DD: notation under MVS
   HRTAG.5='<HR> | tag'
     Used in syntax diagrams
|  SYNFONT={ YES | NO }    Default: NO
|    Use fonts within syntax diagrams (e.g. keywords in bold, variables in
|    italics)?  Some browsers use a different character width for bold/italic
|    text than for regular text which causes alignment problems within the
|    diagram.  If all your users are using browsers that do not exhibit this
|    behavior, specify SYNFONT=YES, otherwise stay with the default SYNFONT=NO.
 
User's Guide:
-------------
  o  Include example of a syntax diagram
  o  Document new "B2H317", "B2H462" and "B2H463" error messages

|    "DEF" inadvertently used as the filetype
| o  Script/VS labels with a blank before the name ("... name") not recognized
| o  In CMS, symbol &b2hitime (time stamp of input file) not defined
 
Bugs fixed in R4.01:
--------------------
  o  ".NAMEFILE" macro ignored when B2H run on a PC platform
  o  Hypertext links for a header back to a TOC in the *same* physical file
     generated as HREF="filename#label" instead of HREF="#label" causing some
     browsers to reload an already-loaded file
  o  User exit program defined for a user tag (e.g. ":user.") unable to
     insert Script/Bookmaster text
  o  Problem when specifying the physical output filename on ".*B2H BREAK"
     when run under VM

B2H-specific updates:
--------------------
  o  MVS is now a supported platform; B2H can run either as a stand-alone
     program or as a MVS/BatchPipeWorks pipeline filter. When run stand-alone,
|    the input file can be specified either by referencing the dataset itself
|    or by DD, like this:
|      B2H ABC.DEF
|      B2H 'ABC.DEF'
|      B2H DD:ddname

     -  Default filetype for HTMLEXT= and HTMPEXT= now "HTML" (was "HTM")
 
  o  The name "Advantis" changed to "IBM Corporation" within all files of
     the package as Advantis is now a part of IBM
 
| o  CHARSET= option added to support coded character sets associated with
|    the generated HTML document
 
 
New/Updated B2H options:
------------------------
 
   B2HREQ={ YES | NO }                     Default: B2HREQ=YES
     B2H supports various options specified as a Script "comment" (first
     two characters are ".*"), such as ".*B2H OPTION" and ".*B2H HTML".
     This parameter specifies whether the "B2H" string is required or may
     be omitted.  If B2HREQ=NO, then either the ".*OPTION" or the
     ".*B2H OPTION" format may be used.  If B2HREQ=YES (the default), only
     the ".*B2H OPTION" format is allowed and ".*OPTION" is ignored.
 
     In Release 4.0, the default is now "YES" (prior releases defaulted
     to "NO").
 
|  CHARSET='xxxx'
|    This option allows you to specify the coded character set used to encode
|    the document. If a value is specified, B2H generates the following:
|      <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=xxxx">
|    If no value is specified (the default), no META statement is generated
|    and the normal World Wide Web default of ISO-8859-1 is assumed.
|    The B2H User's Guide has additional information and a table of
|    suggested values for various countries.
|    e.g. CHARSET='iso-8859-8'   (Hebrew)
 
   DEFTEXT.name='text'
     Additional names defined to support :IBMLPS and :WARRANTY tags
 
   DESTSYS={AIX|HPFS|MVS|OS2|VM|WIN95|WINNT}
     Specifies the system on which the HTML source will be browsed (e.g. the
     system on which the Web server and/or browser will be run). The default
     is the platform and mode on which B2H is run.
 
   DESTSYS=VM
   HTMLEXT=HTML
   HTMPEXT=HTML
     New default values when running on VM/CMS
 
   MVSALLOC.name='ALLOC-command-operands'
     When running on MVS, if the named dataset needs to be created, these
     are the operands to use on the TSO/E "ALLOC" command.  "name" is:
       ANSFILE  - The answer file for Question/Answers (if requested)
       LOG      - Disk copy of the console log
|      OUTPUTPO - The output HTML file if creating a partitioned data set
|      OUTPUTPS - The output HTML file if creating a sequential data set;
|                 if multiple sequential output files are created, this
|                 applies to each output file
       SYSVARW  - The output file written if SYSVAR="W filespec" specified
       TEMP     - B2H's temporary work file
       TRACE    - B2H's internal trace file (for system support use)
|    Default value for all, except OUTPUTPO, is:
|      'DSORG(PS) LRECL(1024) RECFM(V) TRACKS SPACE(5,5) RELEASE'
|    Default value for OUTPUTPO, is:
|      'DSORG(PS) LRECL(1024) RECFM(V) TRACKS SPACE(5,5) RELEASE DIR(10)'
 
   PROCACT='sit=action sit=action ...'
     What type of action should B2H take when certain situations occur during
     processing?  New "NOINDEX" situation specifies what to do when the INDEX
     or INDEX=YES option was specified, but no :INDEX. tag was encountered
     in the source.  Default: PROCACT=NOINDEX=WARNING
 
   { QUIET | NOISY }
     Specifies whether messages issued during the conversion should be
     displayed on the terminal.
       NOISY - Display messages on the terminal
       QUIET - Do not display messages on the terminal
     Default is "QUIET" if B2H is running as a pipeline filter, else
     "NOISY" is assumed.
