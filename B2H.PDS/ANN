  B2H - Convert Bookmaster, GML, Script/VS and "flat" files to HTML
 
  Background:
  -----------
 
  If your organization is like mine, establishing a presence on the
  Internet by using a World-Wide-Web server and defining a Home Page is
  the "thing to do".  You can either use someone else's WEB server or
  install your own.
 
  We had plenty of documents to place on the server.  Some were written
  using BookMaster, GML and Script/VS markup, while others existed as
  normal "flat" files.  Even though the WEB's HTML language is conceptually
  simple, the thought of manually converting the desired files from their
  source format to HTML was daunting.
 
  Although there are a few HTML converters around, none met all our major
  requirements. So we ended up writing our own, called it B2H, and are
  making it available for other organizations.  (John Dorval provided the
  source for BookHype, which was used as a starting point.  Thanks John!)

  What does B2H do?
  -----------------
  B2H reads files written in Bookmaster, Generalized Markup Language (GML),
  Script/VS, and even "flat" files, and converts them into HTML format
  suitable for use in an Internet World-Wide-Web environment.
 
  B2H Highlights:
  ---------------
 
  o  Converts most commonly-used tags, control words, macros and symbols
     of BookMaster, GML and Script/VS (DCF)
 
  o  Supports conversion of "flat" files
 
  o  Output conforms to HTML Release 2, 3 or 4, as specified at
     execution time
 
  o  Can generate full and partial tables-of-contents; and if generated,
     options are available for specifying the table-of-content's format
 
  o  Can generate an index; and if generated, options are available for
     specifying the index's format
 
  o  Can generate figure and table lists
 
  o  Can automatically generate hypertext links within the file itself:
     -  Table-of-Contents (TOC):
        o  From the TOC to each section
        o  From each section back to the main TOC
        o  If a partial TOC is available:
           -  From a partial TOC to each associated section
           -  From each section back to the most-recent partial TOC
           -  From each partial TOC back to the main TOC
     -  Figure Lists and Table Lists:
        o  From the List of Figures to each figure
        o  From the List of Tables to each table
        o  From each Figure or Table back to it's associated list
     -  Footnotes:
        o  From a footnote's reference to it's definition
        o  From each footnote definition back to it's initial reference
     -  Index (if generated):
        o  From the index back to each referenced item
        o  An optional Index TOC for the index itself can be generated
     -  Cross-references (e.g. :hdref, :figref) are converted into a
        hypertext link to the target
     -  From a question's answer back to the original question
 
  o  Supports cross-referencing of multi-volume documents
 
  o  "Boilerplate" records can be automatically inserted into the beginning
     and/or end of the output HTML file (which could be used to ensure that
     standard navigational links are at the bottom of all files)
 
  o  "Mast Head" information can be included in the output
 
  o  Explicit HTML statements can be included in the source file to
     support specialized requirements
 
  o  The output HTML file can be split into multiple HTML files,
     useful for large source files -- allowing the reader to retrieve
     only sections which are of interest, reducing document load time
 
  o  Bookmaster tables are supported. If HTML 3 output is being generated
     (the default), HTML 3 table tags are used; for HTML 2 output, B2H
     switches to a monospaced font and builds the table manually
 
  o  Supports line drawings created by XEDITG and CHARGES
 
  o  Supports syntax ("railroad") diagrams
 
  o  Supports Script's conditional sections (.cs), BookMaster's "vanilla"
     DVCF macros (.config and .when) and process controls (:PSC) for
     dynamically altering the content of the document
 
  o  Supports BookMaster Question and Answer tags and can generate either
     textual output (as Bookmaster does) or interactive HTML FORMs which
     can be used with an installation-provided CGI program to verify the
     user's answers
 
| o  Runs on AIX, Linux, MVS (OS/390), OS/2, VM/ESA, Windows 95/98/ME,
|    Windows NT/2000/XP and Unix.  On VM/ESA, B2H can run either as a
     stand-alone EXEC or as a CMS Pipeline filter.  On MVS, B2H can run
     either as a stand-alone program or as an MVS/BatchPipeWorks
     pipeline filter. B2H is Year2000 ready.
 
  o  Conversion can be performed on one platform (e.g. VM/ESA) and the
     output transferred, stored and used on another platform (e.g. AIX
     or Windows NT)
 
  o  On MVS, the HTML output can be either sequential files or members
     of a partitioned data set (PDS); if using OpenEdition, the files
     can then optionally be transferred to a Hierarchical File System
     (HFS) directory
 
  o  A symbol control file defines how symbols, control words, macros and
     tags are handled.  User-provided symbol control files can be used to
     support installation-specific symbols, control words, macros and tags.
 
  o  Installation-provided exit routines can be invoked to provide custom
     processing for designated control words, macros and tags
 
  o  The output HTML file can contain many META-type statements to
     support HTTP search queries (e.g. keywords, owner, contact,
     document review and expiration dates)
 
  o  Execution can be customized by use of profiles; options can be
     assigned based on the current and/or destination platform
 
  o  Large number of options are available for controlling the conversion
     and customizing the output
 
 
  Software Requirements:
  ----------------------
 
| REXX
|    B2H is written in REXX and requires that REXX be installed on the
|    machine on which it is executed.
|    Two different "flavors" of REXX can be used:
|
|    o  IBM's REXX
|       IBM provides REXX for a variety of platforms.
|       -  On VM and MVS (OS/390), a REXX interpreter is "built-in".
|          An optional REXX compiler is available for a fee.
|       -  For PC platforms, IBM has a variety of Object REXX fee products
|          available. Each PC operating system requires its own REXX product.
|          More information on these is available at
|          http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/orexx
|
|    o  Regina REXX
|       Regina is a free REXX interpreter that has been ported to most
|       Unix platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.)
|       and also to OS/2, eCS, DOS, Win9x/Me/NT/2k/XP, Amiga, QNX,
|       BeOS, MacOS X, EPOC32, AtheOS, OpenVMS and OpenEdition.

  Obtaining B2H
  -------------
 
  o  CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS ON THE INTERNET:
 
     B2H is available on IBM's VM download page on the Internet at
     "http://www.vm.ibm.com/download/".  Follow the directions on the
     download page on how to download and extract the files.
 
 
  o  IBM EMPLOYEES
 
     B2H resides on the VMTOOLS disk.  If your site supports the VM "TOOLCAT"
     command, the following will request a copy:
 
        TOOLCAT VMTOOLS GET B2H PACKAGE
 
     If "TOOLCAT" is not available in your environment, you can request B2H
     from the VMTOOLS master disk (note that it may "batch" your request with
     others and deliver the files on an overnight basis):
 
        TOOLS SENDTO RALVM17 VMTOOLS VMTOOLS GET B2H PACKAGE
 
 
     If you would like to subscribe to B2H so updates are automatically sent
     to you, enter:
 
        TOOLCAT VMTOOLS SUBSCRIBE B2H PACKAGE
             (or)
        TOOLS SENDTO RALVM17 VMTOOLS VMTOOLS SUBSCRIBE B2H PACKAGE
 
 
  ***********************************************************************
 
 
  INSTALLATION:
  -------------
  B2H is easy to install and use right "out-of-the-box".  The B2H User's
  Guide has detailed information on installation and customization, but
  the following shortened versions should get you up and running.
 
  Later on, you may wish to do some customization to tailor B2H's operation
  to your environment and to take advantage of some of the more powerful B2H
  and HTML features.
 
 
| Quick Install-and-Go (AIX, Linux, OS/2, Windows and Unix)
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  o  If you downloaded the ZIP file from the Internet directly onto your PC,
|    unzip it and then proceed to the "If installing on AIX/Linux/Unix" step.
 
     If you retrieved the VMARC file from the Internet, follow the
     instructions on the web page to upload the VMARC file to VM and
     then "extract" the component pieces onto a read/write disk
     (typically your A-disk).
 
     If you ordered the package from an internal IBM tools disk, receive
     the files to a read/write disk (typically your A-disk).
 
  o  There are two ways to get the B2H files onto your workstation:
 
     o  Download the B2H ZIP file and use one of the UNZIP-type programs
        to extract the files. THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED METHOD!  (On AIX, you
        may need to use the "-a" parameter when unzipping the ZIP file)
 
        or
 
     o  Download the individual files using the suggested naming convention
        shown below (NOT THE RECOMMENDED METHOD!).
        If you *must* download the individual files, please note:
 
        o  For the main program, ensure that you download B2H SEXEC and
           *not* the other EXEC-type files (they are the compiled versions
           for other platforms).
 
        o  The files were created on a U.S. system.  If downloading to
           a non-U.S. system, be careful to ensure you use the correct
           translate table.  An incorrect translate table during download
           can often cause "Invalid character in program" error messages
           when trying to execute B2H.

| o  If installing on AIX/Linux/Unix:
 
     o  Ensure that REXX is available as listed previously in
        "Software Requirements"
 
     o  If you downloaded the ZIP file and unzipped it, you may want to
|       rename the files to their AIX/Linux/Unix equivalent
 
     o  The "B2HNAME" script will do the necessary renames and "fix-up"
|       to allow easy execution of B2H in an AIX/Linux/Unix environment.
        In the subdirectory into which you placed the files, run the
        following two commands:
           chmod +x b2hname
          ./b2hname
 
| o  If installing on Windows 95/98/ME or Windows NT/2000/XP:
 
     o  Ensure that REXX is available as listed previously in
        "Software Requirements"
 
     o  Depending on how ObjectREXX is installed, you may need to rename
        B2H.CMD to B2H.REX
 
  o  Try converting a test file which is typical of the Bookmaster/GML
     source files you will be processing:
 
       AIX:   B2H file
       Linux: B2H file
       OS/2:  B2H fn.ext
       Win95: REXX B2H fn.ext
       WinNT: REXX B2H fn.ext
|      Unix:  B2H file
 
|    Point your browser at the resulting HTML file ("fn.HTM" on OS/2 or
|    Windows, or "fn.html" on AIX/Linux/Unix).
 
  o  Try running B2H again, this time using different options to vary
     the output format.  For example, specify your own title and do not
     generate a table-of-contents:
 
       AIX:   B2H file        ( TOC=NO TITLE='My sample title'
       Linux: B2H file        ( TOC=NO TITLE='My sample title'
       OS/2:  B2H fn.ext      ( TOC=NO TITLE='My sample title'
       Win95: REXX B2H fn.ext ( TOC=NO TITLE='My sample title'
       WinNT: REXX B2H fn.ext ( TOC=NO TITLE='My sample title'
|      Unix:  B2H file        ( TOC=NO TITLE='My sample title'
 
     Point your browser at the HTML output file.
 
  o  Try converting the "flat" file C:\CONFIG.SYS
 
       AIX:   B2H C:\CONFIG.SYS      ( SOURCE=FLAT TOC=NO TITLE='My Config.Sys'
       Linux: B2H C:\CONFIG.SYS      ( SOURCE=FLAT TOC=NO TITLE='My Config.Sys'
       OS/2:  B2H C:\CONFIG.SYS      ( SOURCE=FLAT TOC=NO TITLE='My Config.Sys'
       Win95: REXX B2H C:\CONFIG.SYS ( SOURCE=FLAT TOC=NO TITLE='My Config.Sys'
       WinNT: REXX B2H C:\CONFIG.SYS ( SOURCE=FLAT TOC=NO TITLE='My Config.Sys'
|      Unix:  B2H C:\CONFIG.SYS      ( SOURCE=FLAT TOC=NO TITLE='My Config.Sys'
 
  o  To see the online help:
 
       AIX:   B2H ?         (or browse B2H.HLP)
       Linux: B2H ?         (or browse B2H.HLP)
       OS/2:  B2H ?         (or browse B2H.HLP)
       Win95: REXX B2H ?    (or browse B2H.HLP)
       WinNT: REXX B2H ?    (or browse B2H.HLP)
|      Unix:  B2H ?         (or browse B2H.HLP)
 
  o  Customize B2H to your needs either by updating the "B2H.PRO" system
     profile or by creating a user profile and using the USERPROF=
     option to process it
 
 
  Quick Install-and-Go (MVS)
  -------------------------
  o  If you downloaded the ZIP file from the Internet directly onto your
     PC, unzip it and upload the files to your TSO id.
 
     Note: The files were created on a U.S. system.  If uploading to
           a non-U.S. system, be careful to ensure you use the correct
           translate table.  An incorrect translate table during upload
           can often cause "Invalid character in program" error messages
           when trying to execute B2H.
 
     If you retrieved the VMARC file from the Internet, follow the
     instructions on the web page to upload the VMARC file to VM and
     then "extract" the component pieces onto a read/write disk
     (typically your A-disk). Then send the files to the TSO user ID doing
     the installation.
 
     If you ordered the package from an internal IBM tools disk, have the
     files sent directly to your TSO user ID.
 
  o  The User's Guide has more information on installation and customization
     to make B2H easier to use in an MVS (OS/390) environment, but this
     shortened version will get you up and running.
 
     Note: The MVS version of B2H was tested using MVS/ESA 5.2.2 and
           TSO/E R2.05
 
     1. INSTALL THE B2H PROGRAM ITSELF:
        Two versions of the B2H program are available for MVS: "B2H SEXEC"
        is the REXX source code and "B2H MVSCEXEC" is the MVS REXX compiled
        version. The compiled version runs much faster but requires the
        REXX compiler run-time libraries. The source code runs slower, but
        has no additional dependencies. Select the version that best meets
        your needs.  (Note: if you retrieved just the ZIP file from the
        Internet, only the REXX source code (B2H.CMD) is provided within
        the ZIP file.)
 
        Determine the partitioned data set (PDS) to hold the B2H program.
        If you have a PDS already containing other REXX execs, you may
        wish to use that one. Place the selected program file into the
        PDS using a member name of "B2H"
 
     2. INSTALL THE B2H SYSTEM FILES:
        o  Place the B2H system profile (B2H PROFILE) into a sequential
           file, such as 'userid.B2H.PROFILE'
        o  Place the B2H system symbol table (B2H SYMBOLS) into a
           sequential file, such as 'userid.B2H.SYMBOLS'
        o  Place the B2H help file (B2H HELPCMS) into a sequential file,
           such as 'userid.B2H.HELP'
 
     3. THE OPTIONAL FILES
        The remainder of the files in the B2H package are optional.
        These consist of such files as the User's Guide (in source,
        LIST3820 and HTML formats) and various sample files.
        Whether they should be received and saved is at your discretion.
 
  o  On your TSO userid, allocate B2H's system files using the following:
       ALLOC FI(B2HPROF) DA(profile-dataset-name)      SHR REUSE
       ALLOC FI(B2HSYM)  DA(symbol-table-dataset-name) SHR REUSE
       ALLOC FI(B2HHELP) DA(help-dataset-name)         SHR REUSE
 
     To allow you to invoke B2H by just entering it's name, allocate the
     "SYSEXEC" file to the PDS into which you saved the B2H program:
       ALLOC FI(SYSEXEC) DA(pds-dataset-name) SHR REUSE
 
  o  Try converting a test file which is typical of the Bookmaster/GML
     source files you will be processing:
 
       B2H filespec
 
     Examples using files stored under your userid:
       B2H test1.script
       B2H proj23.script(chap1)
 
     Examples using files NOT stored under your userid:
       B2H 'SYS3.ISO9000.SCRIPT'
       B2H 'mvs1.org.text(guide)'
 
     Convert the sequential dataset(s) allocated to DD "FILEIN":
       B2H DD:FILEIN
 
     Convert member MEM1 within the partition dataset(s) allocated
     to DD "FILEIN":
       B2H DD:FILEIN(MEM1)
 
     If you have an MVS-based web browser, point it at the HTML output
     file, e.g. filespec.HTML, TEST1.HTML, PROJ23.SCRIPT.CHAP1.HTML
 
     Note: if you will be transferring the HTML output to a platform other
     than MVS and browsing it there, you can tell B2H to customize it's
     output for that platform, like:
 
       B2H filespec ( DESTSYS=AIX
       B2H filespec ( DESTSYS=LINUX
       B2H filespec ( DESTSYS=OS2
       B2H filespec ( DESTSYS=VM
       B2H filespec ( DESTSYS=WIN95
       B2H filespec ( DESTSYS=WINNT
|      B2H filespec ( DESTSYS=UNIX
 
  o  Try running B2H again, this time using different options to vary
     the output format.  For example, specify your own title and do not
     generate a table-of-contents:
 
       B2H filespec ( TOC=NO TITLE="My sample title"
 
  o  Try converting the "flat" file SYS1.PROCLIB(TSO):
 
       B2H 'SYS1.PROCLIB(TSO)' ( SOURCE=FLAT TITLE="Member TSO"
 
  o  To see the online help (requires ISPF to be active):
 
       B2H ?
 
  o  Customize B2H to your needs either by updating the "B2H.PROFILE"
     system profile or by creating a user profile and using the USERPROF=
     option to process it
 
 
  Quick Install-and-Go (VM)
  -------------------------
  o  If you retrieved the VMARC file from the Internet, follow the
     instructions on the web page to upload the VMARC file to VM and
     then "extract" the component pieces onto a read/write disk
     (typically your A-disk).
 
     If you downloaded the ZIP file from the Internet directly onto your
     PC, unzip it and upload the files to your VM id.
 
     Note: The files were created on a U.S. system.  If uploading to
           a non-U.S. system, be careful to ensure you use the correct
           translate table.  An incorrect translate table during upload
           can often cause "Invalid character in program" error messages
           when trying to execute B2H.
 
     If you ordered the package from an internal IBM tools disk, receive
     the files to a read/write disk (typically your A-disk).
 
  o  Two versions of the B2H program are available for VM: "B2H SEXEC"
     is the REXX source code and "B2H EXEC" is the VM REXX compiled
     version.  The compiled version runs much faster but requires the
     REXX compiler run-time libraries.  The source code runs slower,
     but has no additional dependencies.  Ensure that the filetype of
     the desired version is "EXEC".
 
  o  Try converting a test file which is typical of the Bookmaster/GML
     source files you will be processing:
 
       B2H fn ft fm
 
     If you have a VM-based web browser, point it at the HTML output
     file "fn HTML A".  For example:  WWW FILE://fn.HTML
 
     Note:  if you will be browsing the HTML output on a platform other
     than VM/CMS, you can tell B2H to customize it's output for that
     platform, like:
 
       B2H fn ft fm ( DESTSYS=AIX
       B2H fn ft fm ( DESTSYS=LINUX
       B2H fn ft fm ( DESTSYS=MVS
       B2H fn ft fm ( DESTSYS=OS2
       B2H fn ft fm ( DESTSYS=WIN95
       B2H fn ft fm ( DESTSYS=WINNT
|      B2H fn ft fm ( DESTSYS=UNIX
 
     Transfer the HTML output file to the desired platform and point your
     web browser at it.
 
  o  Try running B2H again, this time using different options to vary
     the output format.  For example, specify your own title and do not
     generate a table-of-contents:
 
       B2H fn ft fm ( TOC=NO TITLE='My sample title'
 
  o  Try converting the "flat" file PROFILE EXEC:
 
       B2H PROFILE EXEC A ( SOURCE=FLAT TOC=NO TITLE='My Profile Exec'
 
  o  To see the online help:
 
       B2H ?
 
  o  Customize B2H to your needs either by updating the "B2H PROFILE"
     system profile or by creating a user profile and using the USERPROF=
     option to process it

  B2H User's Guide
  ----------------
  Print the provided B2H LIST3820 file or format/print the BookMaster
  source (B2H SCRIPT).
 
  Or better yet, point your browser at one of the HTML versions of the
  User's Guide: "B2H HTML" uses HTML 3 tags, "B2HR2 HTML" contains only
  HTML 2 tags.
 
 
  If you would like, try converting the BookMaster source for the User's
  Guide to HTML.  Since the document may be larger than anything you'll be
  placing on a WEB server, if your environment has the resources to
  convert it successfully, then you should be able to convert most
  anything!
 
  Examples:  (shown using VM naming convention)
 
    Convert the User's Guide into a single, large HTML file:
       B2H b2h script ( log=yes
 
    Convert the User's Guide and split the HTML output into smaller
    files to allow easier loading:
       B2H b2h script ( log=yes autosplit='*1 bypass=1'
